        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Ricardo Vargas I am a hardworking college student (3.9/4.0 GPA) that is currently attending University of California Riverside in hopes of graduating with a BA in Psychology to find a job within the business sector in either marketing or sales. My current professional experience includes working as a peer mentor at my community college which focused on advising students how to navigate into their transition from high school to community college. Some of my responsibilities included facilitating presentations and workshops, conducting 1 on 1 meetings with students, working with fellow mentors and program coordinators to help fulfil program goals and coordinate events as well as provide information about campus wide resources. I also spent time volunteering off campus at Kaiser Permanente as a care ambassador that assisted nurses with patient needs and services. This included restocking medical supplies, making copies and packets of company papers, cleaning out rooms, exchanging information between nurses and patients, and interacting with patients to provide commodities or just keeping them company. Some of my skills include proficiency in English and Spanish writing/speaking, experience with Microsoft Office suite, great communication skills, detail-oriented, adaptable, great research skills and quick problem-solving skills. Some of my achievements include making the Dean's Honor List for Spring 2019, Fall 2019, Spring 2020 and Fall 2020 semester, attaining my Associates in Science for Math and Science, Associates in Arts for Social and Behavioral Studies, and Associates in Arts for Psychology-all with Great Distinction. With that being said I expect to excel at UCR as well and in the near future hope find a position that will challenge me to utilize my skills where I can help contribute to an organization as well as gain some new skills. network connections and drive for the industry. Thank you for taking the time to read my biography.<br><br>

        When I am not focused on my studies I like to dedicate my time doing physical activities because I whole heatedly believe that the mind and body are connected that so I Like going out for bike rides on my Giant Escape 2, practicing my boxing skills, playing soccer, or just doing some general work outs. Besides these physical activties that I partake in I also like watching a lot of educational/motivational youtube videos such asGaryVee, LEMMiNO, What If, PurSuit of Wonder, Psych2Go, KentoBento, Deep Look and Better Ideas. When I'm not fueling my brain and body I like to spend a lot of my time with friends and family doing things such as bowling, mini-golfing, hiking or work on some of my other hobbies like video games, watching movies and shows and video/photo editing. <br><br>

        My future aspirations are to ultimately become a community college advisor at Norco College where I graduated from but in the mean time I wanted to gain some work experinece and save up some money to pay for the Masters program which is why I want to get into sales or marketing but I also feel like these roles would be a good fit for me because I am a people person and have good analytical skills to convince people through images or through speech.
